On 13th Jan, I conducted a webinar, titled Mastering Git: Best Practices and Techniques.

It was a Free / Pay-as-you-wish session and a part of my earnings went to the Yuvraj Singh Foundation (YouWeCan) foundation.

50+ People registered, and Close to 20 joined the webinar and stayed through it.

I recorded the session with thoughts to Share the knowledge with a larger audience.

Hence, I strongly believe this one-hour video will be really helpful for you to get started with your git and tech journey.
