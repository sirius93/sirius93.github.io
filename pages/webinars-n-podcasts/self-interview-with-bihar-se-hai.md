Recently, I had the opportunity to do a self-shot interview with Bihar se hai to talk about my experience "hacking" an airline website to retrieve my lost luggage.

During the interview, I shared the story of how I had lost my luggage during a flight and was struggling to get it back. Frustrated with the lack of response from the airline, I decided to take matters into my own hands and started investigating their website.

After some digging, I discovered a vulnerability in their system that allowed me to access my booking details and retrieve my luggage. Excited about my success, I took to Twitter to share my experience and the tweet soon went viral.

The media attention that followed was overwhelming, with major news outlets around the world covering the story. It was an exhilarating experience, and I was grateful for the opportunity to shed light on the importance of data privacy and security in the digital age.
