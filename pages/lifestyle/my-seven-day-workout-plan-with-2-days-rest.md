# I created a beginner friendly seven day workout plan for you, so you don't have to

Are you a male in your late twenties (Just like me) looking for a workout plan that accommodates your desk job and allows for adequate rest to prevent injury? 

Look no further! I've created a comprehensive full-body workout plan that's perfect for busy professionals like you.

To ensure that you stay active despite your desk job, this workout plan incorporates a variety of exercises that target different muscle groups. Additionally, to avoid burnout and injury, I've included two rest days, one on Wednesday and the other on Sunday.

Please note that as an intermittent faster, I fast on Tuesdays, so you may choose to adjust the plan accordingly.

I'm sharing this plan with the hope that it will help you kickstart your fitness journey and achieve your health goals.
